## 🔵 Project Overview

**Cure** is a team-based doctor appointment system that allows users to:

- Browse doctors and their specialties  
- Manage appointments  
- Handle personal profiles and favorites  

The project focuses on a responsive UI, clear user flows, and reliable frontend state management.

> **Note:** Due to instability in the backend server during development, some features were migrated to **Firebase** and **Context API** as an alternative solution.
